St. Vianney was a French Catholic priest who is venerated in the Catholic
Church as a saint and the patron saint of parish priests. He is often referred to as the "Cure d'Ars"
(i.e. the parish priest of Ars) and is internationally known for his priestly and pastoral work in his
parish in Ars, France, because of the radical spiritual transformation of the community and its surroundings.
Catholics attribute this to his saintly life, mortification, persevering ministry in the sacrament of
confession and ardent devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary. Vianney was born in the French town of Dardilly
and was baptized on the same day. The Vianneys were devout Catholics who helped the poor. Vianney's paternal
grandparents once gave hospitality to St. Benedict Joseph Labre, the patron saint of the homeless, who
passed through Dardilly on his pilgrimage to Rome in 1770.
