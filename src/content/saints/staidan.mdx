St. Aidan of Lindisfarne was an Irish monk and missionary credited with
converting the Anglo-Saxons to Christianity in Northumbria. He founded a monastic cathedral on the
island of Lindisfarne, known as Lindisfarne Priory, served as its first bishop, and travelled ceaselessly
throughout the countryside, spreading the gospel to both the Anglo-Saxon nobility and the
socially disenfranchised (including children and slaves). He is known as the Apostle of Northumbria and
is recognised as a saint by the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Catholic Church, the Anglican Communion
and others.
