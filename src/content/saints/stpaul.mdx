St. Paul was an apostle (although not one of the Twelve Apostles) who taught the Gospel of
Christ to the 1st-century world. Paul is generally considered one of the most important figures of the
Apostolic Age, and from the mid-30s to the mid-50s AD, he founded several Christian communities in Asia
Minor and Europe. According to the New Testament book Acts of the Apostles, Paul participated in the
persecution of the "embryonic Christian Movement" in the area of Jerusalem, prior to his conversion. In
the narrative of the Acts, Paul was travelling on the road from Jerusalem to Damascus on a mission to
"arrest them and bring them back to Jerusalem" when the ascended Jesus appeared to him in a great bright
light. He was struck blind, but after three days his sight was restored by Ananias of Damascus. Paul then
began to preach that Jesus of Nazareth is the Jewish Messiah and the Son of God.
