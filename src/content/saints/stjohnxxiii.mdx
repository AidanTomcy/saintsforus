Pope John XXIII was Bishop of Rome and hence head of the Catholic Church
and sovereign of the Vatican City State from 28 October 1958 to his death in 1963. John was one of thirteen
children born to a family of sharecroppers who lived in a village in Lombardy. He was ordained to the
priesthood on 10 August 1904 and served in a number of posts, including as nuncio in France and delegate to
Bulgaria, Greece and Turkey. In a consistory on 12 January 1953, Pope Pius XII made John the Cardinal-Priest
of Santa Prisca, in addition to naming him as the Patriarch of Venice. He was unexpectedly elected Pope on
28 October 1958 at the age of 76 after 11 ballots. Pope John XXIII surprised those who expected him to be a
caretaker Pope by calling the historic Second Vatican Council (1962-1965), the first session opening on 11
October 1962.
