St. Peter, also known as Simon Peter, was one of the Twelve Apostles of Jesus Christ
and one of the first leaders of the Early Church. According to Christian tradition, Peter was crucified
in Rome under Emperor Nero. He is traditionally counted as the first Bishop of Rome or Pope and also
as the first Patriarch of Antioch by the Eastern Christian tradition. The ancient Christian churches all venerate
Peter as a major saint and as the founder of the Church of Antioch and the Diocese of Rome, but differ in
their attitudes regarding the authority of his successors. According to Catholic teaching, in Matthew 16:18,
Jesus promised Peter a special position in the church.
