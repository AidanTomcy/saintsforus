St. Therese of Lisieux was a French Catholic Discalced Carmelite nun
who is widely venerated in modern times. She is popularly known as "The Little Flower of Jesus," or simply
"The Little Flower." Therese has been a highly influential model of sanctity for Catholics and for others
because of the simplicity and practicality of her approach to the spiritual life. Together with Francis of
Assisi, she is one of the most popular saints in the history of the Church. Pope Pius X called her "the
greatest saint of modern times." Therese felt an early call to religious life and after overcoming various
obstacles in 1888, at the early age of 15, she became a nun and joined two of her older sisters in the
cloistered Carmelite community of Lisieux, Normandy. She died at the young age of 24 from tuberculosis.
