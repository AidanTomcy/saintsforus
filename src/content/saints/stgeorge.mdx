St. George was a Christian of Cappadocian Greek origins, who is accepted
as a saint in Christianity. According to traditional rumours, he was a soldier in the Roman Army. His
parents were Christians of Greek origin. His father, Gerontius, was a Cappadocian serving in the Roman
Army. His mother, Polychronia, was a Christian from the city of Lod in Palestine. St. George was a soldier,
a member of the Praetorian Guard for Roman Emperor Diocletian, who was sentenced to death for refusing to
recant his Christian faith. He became one of the most venerated saints and megalomartyrs in Christianity,
and he has been seen especially as a military saint since the Crusades.
