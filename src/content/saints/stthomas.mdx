St. Thomas was one of the Twelve Apostles of Jesus according to the
New Testament. Thomas is commonly known as "Doubting Thomas" because he doubted Jesus' ressurection when
first told of it. Later, he confessed his faith, "My Lord and my God," on seeing Jesus' crucifixion wounds.
According to traditional accounts of the Saint Thomas Christians of modern-day Kerala in India, Thomas is
believed to have travelled outside the Roman Empire to preach the Gospel, going as far as the Malabar Coast
which is in modern-day Kerala. According to their tradition, Thomas reached Muziris (modern-day North-Paravur
and and Kodungalloor in Kerala) in AD 52. In 1258, some of the relics were brought to Ortona, in Abbruzo,
Italy, where they have been held in the Church of Saint Thomas the Apostle. He is often regarded as the patron
saint of India.
