St. Joseph is a figure in the Canonical Gospels who was married to Mary, Jesus' mother,
and was Jesus' legal father. The Gospels name brothers of Jesus, but the Gospel of James, an apocryphal
work of the late 2nd century, explained that they were the sons of Joseph from an earlier marriage. This
position is still held in Orthodox Churches, but in the Western Church it was dropped in favour of St.
Jerome's argument that Joseph, like Mary, must have been a lifelong virgin and that the "brothers" must
have been his cousins. Perspectives on Joseph as a historical figure are distinguished from a theological
reading of the Gospel texts.
