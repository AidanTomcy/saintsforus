St. Nicholas, also known as Nicholas of Bari, was an early Christian Bishop
of Greek Descent from the maritime city of Myra in Asia Minor during the time of the Roman Empire. Because
of the many miracles attributed to his intercession, he is also known as Nicholas the Wonderworker. St.
Nicholas is the patron saint of sailors, merchants, archers, repentant thieves, prostitutes, children,
brewers, pawnbrokers, unmarried people and students in various cities and countries around Europe. His
reputation evolved among the faithful, as was common among early Christian Saints, and his legendary habit
of secret gift-giving gave rise to the traditional model of Santa Claus through Saint Nicholas.
