St. Bernadette was the firstborn daughter of a miller from Lourdes in the
department of Hautes-Pyrenees in France. She is best known for experiencing Marian Apparitions of a "young lady"
who asked for a Chapel to be built at the nearby cave-grotto at Massabielle. These apparitions are said to have
occured between 11 February and 16 July 1858, and the woman who appeared to her identified herself as the
"Immaculate Conception." After a canonical investigation, Bernadette's reports were eventually declared "worthy of
belief" on 18 February 1862, and the Marian Apparition became known as Our Lady of Lourdes. Since her death, her
body has apparently remained internally incorrupt. On 8 December 1933, Pope Pius XI declared Bernadette a saint.
