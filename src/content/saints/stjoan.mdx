St. Joan of Arc is considered a heroine of France for her role during the
Lancastrian Phase of the Hundred Years War and was canonized as a Catholic saint. She was born
to Jacques d'Arc and Isabelle Romee, a peasant family, at Domremy in the Vosges of northeast
France. Joan claimed to have received visions of the Archangel Michael, St. Margaret and
St. Catherine of Alexandria instructing her to support King Charles VII and recover France from
English domination late in the Hundred Years War. The as-yet-unanointed King Charles VII sent Joan
to the Siege of Orleans as part of a relief army. She was canonized on 16 May 1920 by Pope Benedict XV.
