St. Philip was one of the Twelve Apostles of Jesus according to the New Testament. Later Christian
traditions describe Philip as the Apostle who preached in Greece, Syria and Phrygia. In the Roman
Rite, the feast day of Philip, along with that of James the Less, was traditionally observed on 1
May, the anniversary of the dedication of the Church to Rome. However, the Eastern Orthodox Church
celebrates Philip's feast on 14 November. One of the Gnostic codices discovered in the Nag Hammadi
library in 1945 bears Philip's name in its title, on the bottom line. The Synoptic Gospels list Philip
as one of the apostles. The Gospel of John recounts Philip's calling as a disciple of Jesus, and he is
described as a disciple from the city of Bethsaida.
