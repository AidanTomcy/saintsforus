St. Clare of Assisi is an Italian saint and one of the first followers
of Francis of Assisi. As a child, Clare was devoted to prayer. Although there is no mention of this
in any historical record, it is assumed that Clare was to be married in line with the family tradition.
However, as a teenager, she heard Francis preach during a Lenten service in the Church of San Giorgio
at Assisi and asked him to help her live according to the Gospel. On the evening of Palm Sunday, 20 March
1212, she left her father's house and accompanied by her aunt Bianca and another companion, proceeded to
the Chapel of Poriuncula to meet Francis. There, her hair was cut, and she exchanged her rich gown for a
plain robe and veil. She founded the Order of Poor Ladies, a monastic religious order for women in the
Franciscan tradition.
