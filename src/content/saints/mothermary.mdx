Mother Mary was a first-century Galilean Jewish woman of Nazareth, the wife
of Joseph and the mother of Lord Jesus Christ according to the Canonical Gospels and the Quran. The
Gospels of Matthew and Luke in the New Testament and the Quran describe Mary as a virgin. In Matthew
and Luke, she is betrothed to Joseph. According to Christian theology, she conceived Jesus through the
Holy Spirit while still a virgin. She accompanied Joseph to Bethlehem, where Jesus was born. Catholic
and Eastern Christian teachings claim that at the end of her earthly life, God raised her body directly
into heaven; this is known in the Christian West as the Assumption of Mary.
