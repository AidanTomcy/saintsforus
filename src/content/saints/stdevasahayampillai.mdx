Saint Devasahayam Pillai (born Neelakanta Pillai in the Kingdom of
Travancore and baptized as Lazarus) was an Indian layman of the Catholic Church. He was born in Kanyakumari
district into a Hindu family in the 18th century, but converted to Catholicism and is considered a martyr.
Pope Francis declared Devasahayam Pillai a Saint. Lazarus Devasahayam Pillai and nine others were elevated
as saints by Pope Francis on 15 May 2022. He was an official in the court of the King of Travancore, Maharaja
Marthanda Varma, when he came under the influence of Dutch naval commander, Captain Eustachius De Lannoy, who
instructed him in the Catholic faith. He is believed to have been killed by the Travancore state for upholding
his Christian faith.
