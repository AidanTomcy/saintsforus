St. Francis Xavier was a Spanish Catholic priest, missionary
and saint from Navarre; he was the co-founder of the Society of Jesus. Born in Javier, Kingdom of
Navarre, he was a companion of Ignatius of Loyola and one of the first seven Jesuits who took vows
of poverty and chastity at Montmartre, Paris, in 1534. He led an extensive mission into Asia, mainly
in the Portuguese Empire of the time, and was influential in evangalization work, most notably in India.
He was beatified by Pope Paul V on 25 October 1619 and canonized by Pope Gregory XV on 12 March 1622.
