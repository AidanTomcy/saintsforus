John the Baptist was an itinerant preacher active in the area of the Jordan
River in the early 1st century AD. He is also known as John the Forerunner in Christianity, John the
Immerser in some Baptist Christian traditions, and Prophet Yahya in Islam. He is sometimes alternatively
referred to as John the Baptizer. John is mentioned by the Roman Jewish historian Josephus and revered as
a major religious figure in Christianity, Islam, the Baha'i Faith, the Druze Faith, and Mandaeism. He is
considered to be a prophet of God by all of these faiths, and is honoured as a saint in many Christian
denominations.
