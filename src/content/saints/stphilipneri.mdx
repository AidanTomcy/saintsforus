St. Philip Neri, known as the Second Apostle of Rome, after St. Peter, was
an Italian priest noted for founding a society of secular clergy called the Congregation of the Oratory.
Philip was the son of Francesco di Neri, a lawyer, and his wife Lucrezia da Mosciano, whose family were
nobility in the service of the state. He was accustomed in later life
to ascribe most of his progress to the teaching of two of them - Zenobio de'Medici and Servanzio Mini. At
the age of 18, Philip was sent to his uncle, Romolo, a wealthy merchant at San Germano, a then Neapolitan
town near the base of Monte Cassino, to assist him in his business and with the hope that he might inherit
his uncle's fortune. He gained Romolo's confidence and affection, but soon after coming to San Germano,
Philip had a religious conversion.
