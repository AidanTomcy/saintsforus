St. Sebastian was an early Christian saint and martyr. According to traditional belief,
he was killed during the Roman Emperor Diocletian's persecution of Christians. He was initially tied to
a post or tree and shot with arrows, though this did not kill him. He was, according to tradition, rescued
and healed by St. Irene of Rome, which became a popular subject in 17th-century painting. In all versions
of the story, shortly after his recovery, he went to Diocletian to warn him about his sins, and, as a result,
Sebastian was clubbed to death. He is venerated in the Roman Catholic Church and the Orthodox Church. The
oldest record of the details of Sebastian's martyrdom is a sermon on Psalm 118 by 4th-century Bishop Ambrose
of Milan (St. Ambrose). In his sermon, Ambrose stated that Sebastian came from Milan and that he was already
venerated there at that time. He is the patron saint of athletes.
