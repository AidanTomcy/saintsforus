St. Anthony of Padua, also known as Anthony of
Lisbon, was a Portuguese Catholic Priest and Friar of the Franciscan Order. He
was born and raised by a wealthy family in Lisbon, Portugal, and died in
Padua, Italy. Noted by his contempararies for his powerful preaching, expert
knowledge of scripture and undying love and devotion to the poor and the sick,
he was one of the most quickly canonized saints in church history. He was
proclaimed a Doctor of the Church on 16 January 1946. He is also the patron
saint of lost things.
