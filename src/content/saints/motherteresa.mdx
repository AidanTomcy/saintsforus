Mother Teresa was an Albanian Indian Roman Catholic nun and missionary.
She was born in Skopje (now the capital of North Macedonia), then part of the Kosovo Vilayet of the Ottoman
Empire. After living in Skopje for eighteen years, she moved to Ireland and then to India, where she lived
for most of her life. In 1950, Teresa founded the Missionaries of Charity, a Roman Catholic religious congregation
that had over 4,500 nuns and was active in 133 countries in 2012. The congregation manages homes for people
who are dying of HIV/AIDS, leprosy and tuberculosis. It also runs soup kitchens, dispensaries, mobile clinics,
children's and family counselling programmes and orphanages and schools. Members take vows of chastity, poverty
and obedience and also profess a fourth vow: to give wholehearted free service to the poorest of the poor.
