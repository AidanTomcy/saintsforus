St. John Paul II was the head of the Catholic Church and sovereign of the Vatican
City state from 1978 until his death in 2005. He was elected Pope by the second papal conclave of 1978, which
was called after Pope John Paul I, who had been elected in August to succeed Pope Paul VI, died after 33 days
of being named the Pope. Cardinal Wojtyla was elected on the third day of the conclave and adopted the name of
his predecessor in tribute to him. John Paul II is recognized as helping to end Communist rule in his native
Poland and the rest of Europe. He significantly improved the Catholic Church's relations with Judaism, Islam
and the Eastern Orthodox Church. Born in Poland, John Paul II was the first non-Italian pope since Adrian VI
in the 16th century and the second-longest-serving pope in modern history.
