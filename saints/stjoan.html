            <br />St. Joan of Arc (1412-30 May 1431) is considered a heroine of
            France for her role during the <br />Lancastrian Phase of the
            Hundred Years War and was canonized as a Catholic saint. She was
            born <br />to Jacques d'Arc and Isabelle Romee, a peasant family, at
            Domremy in the Vosges of northeast <br />France. Joan claimed to
            have received visions of the Archangel Michael, St. Margaret and
            <br />St. Catherine of Alexandria instructing her to support King
            Charles VII and recover France from <br />English domination late in
            the Hundred Years War. The as-yet-unanointed King Charles VII sent
            Joan <br />to the Siege of Orleans as part of a relief army. She was
            canonized on 16 May 1920 by Pope Benedict XV.
          </p>
          <h2>Birth and Historical Background</h2>
          <p>
            Joan of Arc was born sometime around 1412 in Domremy, a small
            village in the Meuse valley, which is now
            <br />located in the Vosges department within the historical region
            of Lorraine, France. Her parents were <br />Jacquesd'Arc and
            Isabelle Romee. Joan had at least three brothers and a sister; all
            but one of the brothers <br />was older. Her father was a peasant
            farmer of some means. The family had about 50 acres (20 ha) of land,
            and <br />her father supplemented the family income with a minor
            position as a village official, collecting taxes and <br />heading
            the local watch. Joan was born during the Hundred Years' War, a
            conflictâ€”punctuated by numerous truces <br />between the kingdoms of
            England and France that had begun in 1337.
          </p>
          <h2>Early Life</h2>
          <p>
            It was during the time that the war began to encroach on Domremy
            that Joan had her first vision. Joan
            <br />testified that when she was at the age of 13, around 1425,
            figures she identified as Saint Michael <br />surrounded by angels
            appeared to her in her father's garden. After the vision, she
            reported weeping because <br />she wanted them to take her with
            them. Throughout her life, she continued to have visions of Saint
            Michael, <br />as well as Saint Catherine and Saint Margaret. By
            early 1428, around the same time the English began the
            <br />campaign resulting in the Siege of Orleans, Joan's visions
            told her she must leave Domremy and "go to France" <br />(i.e. the
            core of the kingdom still controlled by Charles' faction) to help
            the Dauphin.
          </p>
          <h2>Rise</h2>
          <p>
            Joan's first meeting with Charles VII took place at the Royal Court
            in the town of Chinon in late February
            <br />or early March 1429. She was aged seventeen and he twenty-six.
            Charles had hidden himself in the crowd among <br />members of the
            court, but Joan quickly identified him and approached him. Joan told
            him that she had come to <br />raise the siege of Orleans and to
            lead him to Reims for his coronation. They also had a private
            exchange that <br />made a strong impression on Charles, but Charles
            and his council needed more assurance. They sent her to Poitiers
            <br />to be examined by a council of theologians to verify her
            morality and ensure her orthodoxy. The council declared <br />her a
            good Catholic and a good person. The theologians at Poitiers did not
            render a decision on the source of <br />Joan's inspiration. But
            they agreed that sending her to Orleans could be useful to the king
            and would test if <br />her inspiration had a divine origin.
          </p>
          <h2>Military Campaigns</h2>
          <p>
            Joan arrived at the besieged city of Orleans on 29 April 1429,
            meeting the commander Jean d'Orleans, acting
            <br />head of the ducal family of Orleans on behalf of his captive
            half-brother. At this point, Orleans was not <br />completely cut
            off, and Dunois was able to get her into the city, where her arrival
            was greeted with great <br />enthusiasm. But Joan was not given any
            formal command, was excluded from military councils, and was kept
            <br />unaware of the Armagnac strategic plans for relieving Orleans.
            The appearance of Joan of Arc at Orleans <br />coincided with a
            change in the pattern of the siege. The last attempt that had been
            made by the defenders to <br />lift the siege had been during the
            previous January, and this attempt had ended in defeat. Within days
            of <br />her arrival, the Armagnacs returned to the offensive. On 4
            May, the Armagnacs attacked the outlying fortress of <br />Saint
            Loup (bastille de Saint-Loup). She arrived just as the Armagnac
            soldiers were retreating after a failed <br />attempt. Her sudden
            appearance caused the soldiers to give out a cheer and engage in
            another assault, which took <br />the fortress.
          </p>
          <h2>Capture</h2>
          <p>
            Before the attack on Paris, Charles had negotiated a four-month
            truce with the Burgundians and it had been
            <br />extended until Easter 1430. Because of this truce, there was
            little for Joan to do between January and March, <br />1430. During
            this time, a letter recorded for Joan by her scribe was sent to the
            Hussites, a heterodox group <br />in the Kingdom of Bohemia that had
            broken with the Roman Catholic Church and had defeated several
            previous <br />crusades sent against them. In the letter, Joan
            threatened to break off her war with the English and attack
            <br />the Hussites if they did not return to orthodox Catholicism.
            On 23 May 1430, Joan accompanied an Armagnac <br />force which
            sortied from the city in an attempt to attack the Burgundian camp at
            Margny, northeast of <br />Compiegne. The force was defeated and
            Joan was captured. She agreed to surrender to a pro-Burgundian
            nobleman <br />named Lyonnel de Wandomme, a member of Jean de
            Luxembourg's contingent.
          </p>
          <h2>Execution</h2>
          <p>
            On 30 May 1431, Joan was executed at the age of about nineteen years
            old. In the morning, she was allowed
            <br />to receive the sacraments despite having been excommunicated.
            Afterwards, she was directly taken to Rouen's <br />Vieux-Marche
            (Old Marketplace), where she was publicly read her sentence of
            condemnation. At this point, <br />she should have been turned over
            to the appropriate authority, the bailiff of Rouen, for secular
            sentencing <br />but she was not. Instead, she was delivered
            directly to the English and tied to a tall plastered pillar for
            <br />execution by burning. She requested to view a cross as she
            died. She was given a cross fashioned from a stick <br />by an
            English soldier, which she kissed and placed next to her chest. A
            processional crucifix was fetched from <br />the church of
            Saint-Saveur. She embraced it before her hands were bound, and Friar
            Isambart de la Pierre held <br />it before her eyes during her
            execution. After she died, the English raked back the coals to
            expose her charred <br />body so that no one could claim she had
            escaped alive. They then cast her remains into the Seine River.
