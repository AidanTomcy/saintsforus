            St. Philip was one of the Twelve Apostles of Jesus according to the
            New Testament. Later Christian
            <br />traditions describe Philip as the Apostle who preached in
            Greece, Syria and Phrygia. In the Roman <br />Rite, the feast day of
            Philip, along with that of James the Less, was traditionally
            observed on 1 <br />May, the anniversary of the dedication of the
            Church to Rome. However, the Eastern Orthodox Church
            <br />celebrates Philip's feast on 14 November. One of the Gnostic
            codices discovered in the Nag Hammadi <br />library in 1945 bears
            Philip's name in its title, on the bottom line. The Synoptic Gospels
            list Philip <br />as one of the apostles. The Gospel of John
            recounts Philip's calling as a disciple of Jesus. He is
            <br />described as a disciple from the city of Bethsaida, and the
            evangelist connects him with Andrew and <br />Peter, who were from
            the same town. He was also among those surrounding John the Baptist
            when the latter <br />first pointed out Jesus as the Lamb of God.

          <h2>New Testament</h2>
          <p>
            The Synoptic Gospels list Philip as one of the apostles. The Gospel
            of John recounts Philip's calling
            <br />as a disciple of Jesus.[Jn 1:43] Philip is described as a
            disciple from the city of Bethsaida, and <br />the evangelist
            connects him with Andrew and Peter, who were from the same town. He
            also was among those <br />surrounding John the Baptist when the
            latter first pointed out Jesus as the Lamb of God. It was Philip
            <br />who first introduced Nathanael (sometimes identified with
            Bartholomew) to Jesus. According to Butler, <br />Philip was among
            those attending the wedding at Cana. Of the four Gospels, Philip
            figures most prominently <br />in the Gospel of John.

          <h2>Christian tradition</h2>
          <p>
            Accounts of Philip's life and ministry exist in the extra-canonical
            writings of later Christians. However,
            <br />some can be misleading, as many hagiographers conflated Philip
            the Apostle with Philip the Evangelist. The <br />most notable and
            influential example of this is the hagiography of Eusebius, in which
            Eusebius clearly <br />assumes that both Philips are the same
            person. As early as 1260, Jacobus de Voragine noted in his Golden
            <br />Legend that the account of Philip's life given by Eusebius was
            not to be trusted. An early extra-biblical <br />story about St.
            Philip is preserved in the apocryphal Letter from Peter to Philip,
            one of the texts in the <br />Nag Hammadi Library, and dated to the
            end of the 2nd century or early 3rd. This text begins with a letter
            from <br />St Peter to Philip the apostle, asking him to rejoin the
            other apostles who had gathered at the Mount of Olives. <br />Fred
            Lapham believes that this letter indicates an early tradition that
            "at some point between the Resurrection <br />of Jesus and the final
            parting of his risen presence from the disciples, Philip had
            undertaken a sole missionary <br />enterprise, and was, for some
            reason, reluctant to return to the rest of the Apostles." This
            mission is in harmony <br />with the later tradition that each
            disciple was given a specific missionary charge. Lapham explains the
            central <br />section, a Gnostic dialogue between the risen Christ
            and his disciples, as a later insertion

          <h2>Relics and Veneration</h2>
          <p>
            Included in the Acts of Philip is an appendix, entitled "Of the
            Journey of Philip the Apostle: From the
            <br />Fifteenth Act Until the End, and Among Them the Martyrdom."
            This appendix gives an account of Philip's <br />martyrdom in the
            city of Hierapolis. According to this account, through a miraculous
            healing and his <br />preaching Philip converted the wife of the
            proconsul of the city. This enraged the proconsul, and he had
            <br />Philip, Bartholomew, and Mariamne all tortured. Philip and
            Bartholomew were then crucified upside-down, <br />and Philip
            preached from his cross. As a result of Philip's preaching the crowd
            released Bartholomew from <br />his cross, but Philip insisted that
            they not release him, and Philip died on the cross. Another legend
            is <br />that he was martyred by beheading in the city of
            Hierapolis. Nowadays relics of Philip the Apostle are in <br />the
            crypt of Basilica Santi Apostoli, Rome. Philip is commonly
            associated with the symbol of the Latin cross. <br />Other symbols
            assigned to Philip include: the cross with the two loaves (because
            of his answer to the Lord <br />in John 6:7), a basket filled with
            bread, a spear with the patriarchal cross, and a cross with a
            carpenter's <br />square. Philip is remembered (with James) in the
            Church of England with a Festival on 1 May.
