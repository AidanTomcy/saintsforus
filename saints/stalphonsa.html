            Alphonsa of the Immaculate Conception or Saint Alphonsa, christened
            at birth as Anna Muttathupadathu
            <br />(19 August 1910- 28 July 1946), was a nun and an educator by
            vocation (profession). She was also known <br />for being a victim
            soul, visionary and prophetess in the Kottayam pergunna of the
            erstwhile Travancore <br />province of British India, the
            present-day Kerala, India. She is the first woman of Indian origin
            to be <br />canonised as a saint after decades of enquiry by the
            Sacred Congregation for the Causes of Saints,she is <br />also the
            first saint of the Syro-Malabar Church, an Eastern Catholic
            community of Eastern Christianity. <br />In the 1990s, a postal
            stamp commemorating Alphonsa was published by Kerala state's former
            minister, <br />K Karunakaran.
          </p>
          <h2>Early Life</h2>
          <p>
            Alphonsa was born as Anna Muttathupadathu in a Malankara Nasrani
            family to Joseph Muttathupadathil and Mary
            <br />Puthukari in Kudamalloor, near Kottayam, on 19 August 1910.
            She was baptised on 27 August. Alphonsamma, <br />as she was locally
            known, was born in Arpookara, a village in the princely state of
            Travancore, what would <br />become Kerala state. The village lies
            within the Archeparchy of Changanassery. Her parents nicknamed her
            <br />Annakutty (little Anna). She had a difficult childhood
            characterised by the loss of a parent and growing up <br />with
            clubbed feet. Her mother died early, so her maternal aunt helped to
            raise her. Hagiographies describe <br />her early life as one of
            hardships at the hands of her stern aunt and foster mother and one
            of teasing by <br />schoolmates. Anna was educated by her
            great-uncle, Joseph Muttathupadathu. When Anna was three-years-old,
            <br />she contracted eczema and suffered for over a year. In 1916,
            Anna started school in Arpookara. She received <br />her First
            Communion on 27 November 1917. When the first school cycle ended in
            1920, the time had come to <br />transfer to Muttuchira, to the
            house of her aunt Anna Murickan, to whom her mother had entrusted
            get, before <br />she died.
          </p>
          <h2>Sister Alphonsa</h2>
          <p>
            As an adolescent Anna received many marriage proposals from reputed
            families. However, she had a feeling in
            <br />her mind that she wants to be a bride of Christ and do good
            things for people. In these years, Therese of Lisieux <br />appeared
            and told her that she will one day become a saint. There are many
            similarities in the lives of Anna <br />and Therese, and she was
            Anna's all-time favorite patron saint and role model. Anna
            sacrificed her material <br />fortune and wanted to dedicate her
            life to Jesus Christ. In 1923, Anna's feet were burnt when she fell
            into a <br />pit of burning chaff; local hagiographies describe this
            as a self-inflicted injury in order to avoid her foster
            <br />mother's attempt to arrange a marriage for her and thereby to
            fulfill her desire for becoming a religious sister <br />instead.
            This accident left her partially disabled for the rest of her life.
            Anna arrived at the Clarist convent <br />at Bharananganam, Kottayam
            district, on Pentecost Sunday 1927.She received the postulant's veil
            on 2 August 1928 <br />and took the name Alphonsa of the Immaculate
            Conception in honor of Alphonsus Liguori, whose feast day it was. On
            <br />19 May 1930 Alphonsa entered the novitiate of the congregation
            at Bharananganam. On 11 August 1931 she completed <br />the
            novitiate and took her first vows. And became a religious in the
            Catholic Church.
          </p>
          <h2>Health Decline</h2>
          <p>
            The period 1930-1935 was characterised by grave illness. Alphonsa
            took her permanent vows on 12 August 1936.
            <br />Two days later she returned to Bharananganam from
            Changanacherry. She then taught high school at St. Alphonsa
            <br />Girl's High School, but was often sick and unable to teach.
            For most of her years as a Clarist sister she endured <br />serious
            illness. In December 1936, it is claimed that she was cured from her
            ailments through the intervention of <br />the Kuriakose Elias
            Chavara (who was beatified at the same ceremony as she), but on 14
            June 1939 she was struck <br />by a severe attack of pneumonia which
            left her weakened. On 18 October 1940, a thief entered her room in
            the middle <br />of the night. This traumatic event caused her to
            suffer amnesia and weakened her again. Her health continued to
            <br />deteriorate over a period of months. She received extreme
            unction on 29 September 1941. The next day it is believed <br />that
            she regained her memory, though not complete health. Her health
            improved over the next few years, until in July <br />1945 she
            developed gastroenteritis and liver problems that caused violent
            convulsions and vomiting. During the last <br />year of her life she
            came to know Sebastian Valopilly (later Bishop of Kerala) who
            frequently brought her communion. <br />This bishop became famous in
            Kerala for championing the cause of poor people from all religious
            backgrounds who had <br />come to live in Thalassery as a result of
            shortages elsewhere.
          </p>
          <h2>Death and Veneration</h2>
          <p>
            After a series of serious health problems, she died on 28 July 1946,
            at a young age of 35. She was buried
            <br />at St. Mary's Catholic Church, Bharananganam, Travancore
            (present day Kottayam district) in the Diocese of <br />Palai. Her
            death news made her loved ones sad. Many people came to see
            Alphonsa's funeral. Claims of her <br />miraculous intervention
            began almost immediately upon her death and often involved the
            children of the <br />convent school where she used to teach. On 2
            December 1953, Cardinal Eugene Tisserant inaugurated the diocesan
            <br />process for her beatification and Alphonsa was declared a
            Servant of God. In 1985, Pope John Paul II formally <br />approved a
            miracle attributed to her intercession and on 9 July she became
            "Venerable Sister Alphonsa". Alphonsa <br />was beatified along with
            Kuriakose Elias Chavara at Kottayam, on 8 February 1986 by Pope John
            Paul II during his <br />apostolic pilgrimage to India. On Sunday,
            12 October 2008, Pope Benedict XVI announced her canonization at a
            <br />ceremony at Saint Peter's Square. Indians from across the
            world, especially people from Kerala, gathered <br />at the ceremony
            in Rome. Among them was a 10-year-old Kerala boy Jinil Joseph whose
            clubfoot - a birth defect - <br />was, in the judgment of Vatican
            officials, miraculously healed after prayers to Alphonsa in 1999.
