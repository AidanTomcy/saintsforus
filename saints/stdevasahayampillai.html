            Saint Devasahayam Pillai (23 April 1712 - 14 January 1752) (born
            Neelakanta Pillai in the Kingdom of
            <br />Travancore and baptized as Lazarus) was an Indian layman of
            the Catholic Church. He was born in Kanyakumari <br />district into
            a Hindu family in the 18th century, but converted to Catholicism and
            is considered a martyr. <br />Pope Francis declared Devasahayam
            Pillai a Saint. Lazarus Devasahayam Pillai and nine others were
            elevated <br />as saints by Pope Francis on 15 May 2022. He was an
            official in the court of the King of Travancore, Maharaja
            <br />Marthanda Varma, when he came under the influence of Dutch
            naval commander, Captain Eustachius De Lannoy, who <br />instructed
            him in the Catholic faith. He is believed to have been killed by the
            Travancore state for upholding <br />his Christian faith.
          </p>
          <h2>Early Life</h2>
          <p>
            Devasahayam was born as Neelakandan Pillai into an affluent
            Nair-caste family at Nattalam in present-day
            <br />Kanyakumari District on 23 April 1712. His father, Vasudevan
            Namboodiri, was a Namboodiri Brahmin from <br />Kayamkulam in
            present-day Kerala state, and was a priest at the Adikesava Perumal
            Temple in Thiruvattar, <br />in present-day Kanyakumari district of
            neighbouring Tamil Nadu. Neelakandan's mother, Devaki Amma, hailed
            <br />from Thiruvattar in Kanyakumari District and belonged to the
            Nair caste. The relationship between Neelakandan's <br />parents
            confirmed to the Sambandam system which was prevalent among the
            matrilineal Nair community in those <br />days. Thus, Neelakandan's
            parents lived in their separate houses and met occasionally;
            Neelakandan belonged <br />to his mother's family and had little
            formal connection with his father's family. In accordance with the
            Nair <br />matrilineal traditions of the day, Neelakandan was raised
            by his mother in the household of his maternal uncle, <br />and was
            inculcated with Hindu beliefs and traditions early on.
          </p>
          <h2>Conversion to Christianity</h2>
          <p>
            In 1741, Captain Eustachius De Lannoy, a Dutch naval commander, was
            sent on command of a naval expedition by
            <br />the Dutch East India Company with the objective of capturing
            and establishing a trading port at Colachel, a port <br />under the
            control of Travancore. In the ensuing Battle of Colachel, fought
            between the Travancore forces and the <br />Dutch forces, the Dutch
            were defeated. De Lannoy's men were either killed or captured.
            Eustachius De Lannoy and <br />his assistant Donadi surrendered and
            were imprisoned. De Lannoy and the Dutchmen were later pardoned by
            the king, <br />on condition that they serve in the Travancore army.
            In the course of time, De Lannoy earned the trust of the king
            <br />and went on to become the commander of the Travancore armed
            forces, the very forces that had earlier defeated him. <br />He
            trained the Travancore forces on European lines, introduced new
            weaponry and gunpowder. As military commander, <br />he won many
            battles for Travancore, resulting in the annexation of various
            neighbouring territories to Travancore.
          </p>
          <h2>Baptism</h2>
          <p>
            On Devasahayam's acceptance of the Christian faith, he was baptized
            at the Roman Catholic sub parish church
            <br />at Vadakkankulam village (in the present-day Tirunelveli
            District of Tamil Nadu), where the Jesuits had a <br />mission under
            Rev. Fr. R. Bouttari Italus S.J. Neelakanda Pillai, his name at
            birth, was then changed to Lazar, <br />although he is more widely
            known by the Tamil & Malayalam translation Devasahayam (meaning
            God's help). Pillai <br />was married by this time to Bhargavi Ammal
            from Kunchu Veedu, Elanthavilai, Mayicode in Travancore State. She
            <br />was baptised alongside her husband as a matter of course. She
            was given the baptismal name "Gnanapoo Ammaal" <br />("Flower of
            Knowledge," equivalent to Theresa in Tamil & Malayalam). Fearing
            reprisal in her native Travancore <br />against her religious
            conversion, she chose to become a migrant-resident of Vadakkankulam
            village. Some other <br />members of Devasahayam Pillai's immediate
            family also received baptism later.
          </p>
          <h2>Other traditions and beliefs</h2>
          <p>
            Devasahayam Pillai was marched from Padmanabhapuram Palace to
            Aralvaimozhy by soldiers, over the period of
            <br />a few days. Pillai was treated like a criminal and as was
            customary in those days for criminals, his body <br />was painted
            with red and black spots, and was intentionally marched through
            populated areas, sitting backward <br />on top of a water buffalo
            (the mythical vehicle or vahana of Yama, the lord of death in
            Hinduism) through the <br />streets of South Travancore. As a method
            of torture, he was beaten every day with eighty stripes, pepper
            rubbed <br />in his wounds and nostrils, exposed to the sun, and
            given only stagnant water to drink. While halting at
            Puliyoorkurichi, <br />not far away from the Padmanabhapuram Palace
            of the Travancore king, it is believed by Christians that God
            quenched <br />his thirst by letting water gush through a small hole
            on a rock, on the very place where he knelt to pray. The water
            <br />hole is still found in the compound of a church at
            Puliyoorkurichi, about 15 km from Nagercoil. It is also believed
            <br />that the leaves of a neem (Margosa) tree in the village of
            Peruvilai, to which he had been tied while being marched <br />to
            Aralvaimozhy, cured illnesses of sick people in the village and
            around. Many more miracles are attributed to <br />Devasahayam
            Pillai.
          </p>
          <h2>Death</h2>
          <p>
            In 1752, the original order of the King and his Dewan was to deport
            him from Travancore, into the Pandya
            <br />country, at Aralvaimozhy. He was let off in the forested hills
            near Aralvaimozhy. There, he is believed to <br />have begun deep
            meditations, and the people from the adjacent villages began
            visiting the holy man. Christian <br />sources allege that at this
            time, high caste Hindus plotted to do away with Devasahayam. Some
            people believe <br />that soldiers went up the forested hills and
            tried to shoot Devasahayam, but were unable to fire; after which
            <br />he took the gun in his hands, blessed it and gave it back to
            the soldiers to shoot him to death, if they wished <br />to. The
            soldiers took the gun back and fired at him five times. His body was
            then carelessly thrown out near <br />the foothills at Kattadimalai.
            It was at Kattadimalai in Kanyakumari district that Devasahayam
            Pillai died on <br />14 January 1752. Pillai's body was later
            recovered by some people of the region and carried to the Church at
            <br />Kottar, in present-day Nagercoil. His mortal remains were
            interred near the altar inside St. Xavier's Church, <br />Kottar,
            Nagercoil, which is now the diocesan Cathedral. Since the days of
            the interment of the mortal remains <br />of Devasahayam Pillai,
            many Christian pilgrims have visited his tomb and offered prayers.
          </p>
          <h2>Beatification and Canonization</h2>
          <p>
            Devasahayam Pillai was declared a Martyr and Blessed on 2 December
            2012, at a solemn ceremony held in the
            <br />Diocese of Kottar at Carmel Higher Secondary School Grounds,
            Nagercoil, near the place of his burial. The <br />Prefect of the
            Congregation for the Causes of Saints, Angelo Cardinal Amato
            presided at the function as <br />Delegate of Pope Benedict XVI.
            Several cardinals, archbishops and bishops from India and elsewhere,
            as well <br />as numerous priests, religious men and women and over
            100,000 Catholics from all over India participated in <br />the
            grand ceremony which included a Solemn Pontifical Mass. Devasahayam
            Pillai is the first lay person from <br />India to be beatified by
            the Catholic Church. On 21 February 2020, Pope Francis recognized a
            miracle attributed <br />to the intercession of Devasahayam,
            clearing his way to canonization (sainthood). The Vatican announced
            on 9 <br />November 2021 that the canonization shall be held on 15
            May 2022.
