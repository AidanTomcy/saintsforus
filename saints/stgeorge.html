            St. George (3rd century AD-23 April 303) was a Christian of
            Cappadocian Greek origins, who is accepted
            <br />as a saint in Christianity. According to traditional rumours,
            he was a soldier in the Roman Army. His <br />parents were
            Christians of Greek origin. His father, Gerontius, was a Cappadocian
            serving in the Roman <br />Army. His mother, Polychronia, was a
            Christian from the city of Lod in Palestine. St. George was a
            soldier, <br />a member of the Praetorian Guard for Roman Emperor
            Diocletian, who was sentenced to death for refusing to <br />recant
            his Christian faith. He became one of the most venerated saints and
            megalomartyrs in Christianity, <br />and he has been seen especially
            as a military saint since the Crusades. In hagiography, as one of
            the Fourteen <br />Holy Helpers and one of the most prominent
            military saints, he is immortalized in the legend of St. George
            <br />and the Dragon. England, Ethiopa, Georgia, Catalonia and
            Aragon in Spain and several other nations, states, <br />cities,
            universities, professions and organizations all claim St. George as
            their patron saint.
          </p>
          <h2>Legend</h2>
          <p>
            Very little is known about George's life, but it is thought he was a
            Roman officer of Greek descent
            <br />from Cappadocia who was martyred in one of the
            pre-Constantinian persecutions. Beyond this, early <br />sources
            give conflicting information. There are two main versions of the
            legend, a Greek and a Latin <br />version, which can both be traced
            to the 5th or 6th century. The saint's veneration dates to the 5th
            <br />century with some certainty, and possibly still to the 4th.
            The addition of the dragon legend dates <br />to the 11th century.
            The earliest text which preserves fragments of George's narrative is
            in a Greek <br />hagiography which is identified by Hippolyte
            Delehaye of the scholarly Bollandists to be a palimpsest <br />of
            the 5th century. An earlier work by Eusebius, Church history,
            written in the 4th century, contributed <br />to the legend but did
            not name George or provide significant detail. The work of the
            Bollandists Daniel <br />Papebroch, Jean Bolland, and Godfrey
            Henschen in the 17th century was one of the first pieces of
            scholarly <br />research to establish the saint's historicity, via
            their publications in <em>Bibliotheca Hagiographica Graeca</em>.
          </p>
          <h2>George and the dragon</h2>
          <p>
            The legend of Saint George and the Dragon was first recorded in the
            11th century, in a Georgian source.
            <br />It reached Catholic Europe in the 12th century. In the Golden
            Legend, by 13th-century Archbishop of <br />Genoa Jacobus da
            Varagine, George's death was at the hands of Dacian, and about the
            year 287. Saint <br />George Killing the Dragon, 1434/35, by Bernat
            Martorell The tradition tells that a fierce dragon was <br />causing
            panic at the city of Silene, Libya, at the time George arrived
            there. In order to prevent the <br />dragon from devastating people
            from the city, they gave two sheep each day to the dragon, but when
            the <br />sheep were not enough they were forced to sacrifice humans
            instead of the two sheep. The human to be <br />sacrificed was
            elected by the city's own people and one time the king's daughter
            was chosen to be sacrificed <br />but no one was willing to take her
            place. George saved the girl by slaying the dragon with a lance. The
            king <br />was so grateful that he offered him treasures as a reward
            for saving his daughter's life, but George refused <br />it and
            instead he gave these to the poor. The people of the city were so
            amazed at what they had witnessed <br />that they became Christians
            and were all baptized.
          </p>
          <h2>Veneration</h2>
          <p>
            A titular church built in Lydda during the reign of Constantine the
            Great (reigned 306-337) was consecrated
            <br />to "a man of the highest distinction", according to the church
            history of Eusebius; the name of the titulus <br />"patron" was not
            disclosed, but later he was asserted[by whom?] to have been George.
            The veneration of George <br />spread from Syria Palaestina through
            Lebanon to the rest of the Byzantine Empire - though the martyr is
            not <br />mentioned in the Syriac Breviarium - and the region east
            of the Black Sea. By the 5th century, the veneration <br />of George
            had reached the Christian Western Roman Empire, as well: in 494,
            George was canonized as a saint by <br />Pope Gelasius I, among
            those "whose names are justly reverenced among men, but whose acts
            are known only to <br />[God]."
          </p>
          <h2>Iconography</h2>
          <p>
            George is most commonly depicted in early icons, mosaics, and
            frescos wearing armour contemporary with
            <br />the depiction, executed in gilding and silver colour, intended
            to identify him as a Roman soldier. <br />Particularly after the
            Fall of Constantinople and George's association with the crusades,
            he is often <br />portrayed mounted upon a white horse. Thus, a 2003
            Vatican stamp (issued on the anniversary of the Saint's <br />death)
            depicts an armoured George atop a white horse, killing the dragon.
            George may also be portrayed with <br />Saint Demetrius, another
            early soldier saint. When the two saintly warriors are together and
            mounted upon <br />horses, they may resemble earthly manifestations
            of the archangels Michael and Gabriel. Eastern traditions
            <br />distinguish the two as George rides a white horse and
            Demetrius a red horse (the red pigment may appear black <br />if it
            has bituminized). George can also be identified by his spearing a
            dragon, whereas Demetrius may be <br />spearing a human figure,
            representing Maximian.
