            St. Francis de Sales (21 August 1567-28 December 1622) was the
            Bishop of Geneva and is honoured as a
            <br />saint in the Catholic Church. He became noted for his deep
            faith and gentle approach to the religious <br />divisions in his
            land resulting from the Protestant Reformation. He is known also for
            his writings on <br />the topic of spiritual direction and spiritual
            formation, particularly the Introduction to the Devout <br />Life
            and the Treatise on the Love of God. Francis de Sales was born on 21
            August 1567 in the Chateau <br />de Sales into the noble Sales
            family of the Duchy of Savoy in what is today Thorens-Glieres,
            Haute-Savoie, <br />France. His father was Francois de Sales, Lord
            of Boisy, Sales, and Novel. His mother was Francoise de
            <br />Sionnaz, the only child of the prominent magistrate Melchior
            de Sionnaz and a noblewoman. He was baptized <br />Francis
            Bonaventura after two great Franciscan saints. His father wanted
            him, the first of his six sons, <br />to attend the best schools in
            preparation for a career as a magistrate. He, therefore, enjoyed a
            privileged <br />education in the nearby town of La Roche-Sur-Foron,
            and at the age eight at the Capuchin college in Annecy.
          </p>
          <h2>Education and conversion</h2>
          <p>
            In 1578, de Sales went to the College de Clermont, then a Jesuit
            institution, to study rhetoric and
            <br />humanities. On this first visit to Paris, he lived near the
            Eglise Sainte-Genevieve with his three <br />cousins. As a nobleman,
            he was accompanied by his servant and by a priest tutor, Abbe Deage.
            To please <br />his father, he took lessons in the gentlemanly
            pursuits of riding, dancing, and fencing. De Sales is
            <br />described as intelligent and handsome, tall and well built
            with blue-grey eyes, somewhat reserved and <br />quiet, and a
            welcome guest in the homes of the nobility among whom his father had
            connections. <br />In 1586 Francis de Sales attended a theological
            discussion about predestination, convincing him of his
            <br />damnation to hell. A personal crisis of despair resulted. This
            conviction lasted through December 1586. <br />His great despair
            made him physically ill and even bedridden for a time. Sometime in
            either late December <br />or early January 1587, he visited the old
            parish of Saint-Etienne-des-Gres, Paris, where he prayed the
            <br />"Memorare" before a famed statue of Our Lady of Good
            Deliverance, a Black Madonna. He consecrated himself <br />to the
            Blessed Virgin Mary and decided to dedicate his life to God with a
            vow of chastity He then became <br />a tertiary of the Minim Order.
          </p>
          <h2>Priest and provost</h2>
          <p>
            Because the Calvinists controlled Geneva, the bishop resided about
            twenty miles south, in Annecy. De
            <br />Sales preached in the Cathedral of Annecy, at parish churches,
            and before confraternities. He was an <br />effective speaker, his
            voice was deep and rich in tone, his speech somewhat slow and
            measured. His <br />sermons were comparatively short and without the
            customary displays of erudition. He avoided controversy <br />and
            focused on a particular point of duty, a specific virtue, or the
            correction of some vice The cathedral <br />chapter recommended
            that, although only twenty-seven years of age, the provost be named
            Grand Penitentiary <br />of the diocese, with the result that de
            Sales found himself taking many more confessions.
          </p>
          <h2>Bishop of Geneva</h2>
          <p>
            In 1602, Bishop Granier died, and Sales was consecrated Bishop of
            Geneva by Vespasien Gribaldi, assisted
            <br />by Thomas Pobel and Jacques Maistret, O.Carm. as
            co-consecrators. He resided in Annecy (now part of <br />modern-day
            France) because Geneva remained under Calvinist control and
            therefore closed to him. His diocese <br />became famous throughout
            Europe for its efficient organization, zealous clergy and
            well-instructed laity, <br />an achievement in those days. He worked
            closely with the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin, which was very
            <br />active in preaching the Catholic faith in his diocese. They
            appreciated his cooperation so much that in 1617 <br />they made him
            an official associate of the Order, the highest honor possible for a
            non-member. It is said that <br />at Evian, on the south shore of
            Lake Geneva, St. Francis of Assisi appeared to him and said: "You
            desire martyrdom, <br />just as I once longed for it. But, like me,
            you will not obtain it. You will have to become an instrument of
            your <br />own martyrdom." During his years as bishop, de Sales
            acquired a reputation as a spellbinding preacher and something
            <br />of an ascetic. His motto was, "He who preaches with love,
            preaches effectively." His goodness, patience and mildness
            <br />became proverbial.
          </p>
          <h2>Veneration and Death</h2>
          <p>
            In December 1622 de Sales was required to travel in the entourage of
            Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy,
            <br />for the Duke's Christmas tour of his domain. Upon arrival in
            Lyon, de Sales chose to stay in the gardener's <br />hut at the
            Visitandine monastery in that city. While there he suffered a
            stroke, from which he died on <br />28 December 1622. St. Francis de
            Sales has been styled "the Gentleman Saint" because of his patience
            and <br />gentleness. Despite the resistance of the populace of Lyon
            to moving his remains from that city, Sales was <br />buried on 24
            January 1623 in the church of the Monastery of the Visitation in
            Annecy, which he had founded <br />with Chantal, who was also buried
            there. Their remains were venerated there until the French
            Revolution. <br />Many miracles have been reported at his shrine. De
            Sales' heart was kept in Lyon, in response to the popular
            <br />demand of the citizens of the city to retain his remains.
            During the French Revolution, however, it was saved <br />from the
            revolutionaries by being carried by the Visitation nuns from Lyons
            to Venice. Francis de Sales was <br />beatified in 1661 by Pope
            Alexander VII, who then canonized him four years later. He was
            declared a Doctor of <br />the Church by Pope Pius IX in 1877.
